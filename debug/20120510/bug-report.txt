Dear Jens Kleinjung,

I wanted to use SAP to generate structural alignments for my dataset.
Unfortunately, the program was not able to generate alignments for a few
pairs of proteins and terminates with a "segmentation fault" message. So I
tried to generate those structural alignments on your webserver (
http://mathbio.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/wiki/SAP#Options ) but the calculations of
the webserver also resulted in a segmentation fault.

On the webserver, I tested these pairs of PDBs (please find them also
attached to this mail) and got results with the following jobids:

#PDB1 PDB2 JOBID
1JB0_A2WSC_A 6e8b52039c79c2ce23495f779d8f6a21
2J8S_C 3NE5_A b13242ccf54cbefff72e26de0b7e38e9
3AR7_A 2ZXE_A 616d33944d7a81f0c6b8eecfc78bb503
1FEP_A_3CSL_A b203ab188d728e8fc4235beb15e3a7ba


I will be grateful for any help you can provide me to find out why these
protein pairs can not be aligned or how they can be aligned using SAP.

Kind regards,
Marcus Stamm
