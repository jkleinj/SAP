Purpose
-------
Pairwise (protein) structure alignment.


Installation / Compilation
--------------------------
% tar -zxvf <program>.tgz   # extract program
% cd <program>
% make all                  # compile program
(the message 'missing .d files' at first compilation is normal and can be ignored)

In case something goes wrong:
% make clean                # remove program and binaries
