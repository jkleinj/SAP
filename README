SAP : Pairwise structure alignment using Dynamic Programming
------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
-------
Pairwise (protein) structure alignment.


References
----------
Users publishing results obtained with the program and its applications
should acknowledge its use by the following citation:

	dynamic programming. Protein Sci. 8 (1999) 654-665.

Installation / Compilation
--------------------------
% tar -zxvf <program>.tgz   # extract program
% cd <program>
% make all                  # compile program
(the message 'missing .d files' at first compilation is normal and can be ignored)

In case something goes wrong:
% make clean                # remove program and binaries


Usage
-----
	sap <PDB_1> <PDB_2>

Large proteins might cause a segmentation fault due to stack overflow.
Execute 'unlimit stacksize' (or 'ulimit -s unlimited') as a separate
command before the 'sap' command to avoid stack overflow:
	unlimit stacksize; sap <PDB_1> <PDB_2>
